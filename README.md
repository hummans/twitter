# Twitter clone
This is a Twitter clone I built in PHP during my studies at YRGO university.

Disclosure: This is just a school project, not an actual app or something to be used instead of Twitter. Things might not work or be wonky since this project isn't really maintained.

## Geting started

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Server running Apachce, MySQL and PHP7

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your environment
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/themaxsandelin/twitter
   ```

2. Import the `twitter.sql` file into MySQL, either through the command line or through something like PHPMyAdmin
   ```bash
   $ mysql -u root -p twitter < twitter.sql
   ```

3. Ready to go!
